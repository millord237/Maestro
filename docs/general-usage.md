## UI Overview

Maestro features a three-panel layout:

- **Left Panel** - Agent list with grouping, filtering, search, bookmarks, and drag-and-drop organization
- **Main Panel** - Center workspace with two modes per agent:
  - **AI Terminal** - Converse with your AI agent (Claude Code, Codex, or OpenCode). Supports multiple tabs/sessions, `@` file mentions, image attachments, slash commands, and draft auto-save.
  - **Command Terminal** - PTY shell with tab completion for files, branches, tags, and command history.
  - **Views**: Session Explorer, File Preview, Git Diffs, Git Logs
- **Right Panel** - Three tabs: File Explorer, History Viewer, and Auto Run

## Agent Status Indicators

Each session shows a color-coded status indicator:

- 🟢 **Green** - Ready and waiting
- 🟡 **Yellow** - Agent is thinking
- 🔴 **Red** - No connection with agent
- 🟠 **Pulsing Orange** - Attempting to establish connection
- 🔴 **Red Badge** - Unread messages (small red dot overlapping top-right of status indicator, iPhone-style)

## File Explorer and Preview

Browse project files with syntax highlighting, markdown preview, and image viewing. Reference files in prompts with `@` mentions.

## Output Filtering

Search and filter AI output with include/exclude modes, regex support, and per-response local filters.

## Command Interpreter

The command interpreter can be focused for a clean, terminal-only experience when you collapse the left panel.
