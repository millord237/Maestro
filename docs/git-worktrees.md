title: Git Worktrees
---

Git worktrees enable true parallel development by letting you run multiple AI agents on separate branches simultaneously. Each worktree operates in its own isolated directory, so there's no risk of conflicts between parallel work streams.

## Creating a Worktree Sub-Agent

1. In the session list, hover over an agent in a git repository
2. Click the **git branch indicator** (shows current branch name)
3. In the overlay menu, click **"Create Worktree Sub-Agent"**
4. Configure the worktree:
   - **Worktree Directory** — Base folder where worktrees are created
   - **Branch Name** — Name for the new branch (becomes the subdirectory name)
   - **Create PR on Completion** — Auto-open a pull request when done
   - **Target Branch** — Base branch for the PR (defaults to main/master)

## How Worktree Sessions Work

- **Nested Display** — Worktree sub-agents appear indented under their parent session in the left sidebar
- **Branch Icon** — A git branch icon indicates worktree sessions
- **Collapse/Expand** — Click the chevron on a parent session to show/hide its worktree children
- **Independent Operation** — Each worktree session has its own working directory, conversation history, and state

## Creating Pull Requests

When you're done with work in a worktree:

1. **Right-click** the worktree session → **Create Pull Request**, or
2. Press **Cmd+K** with the worktree active → search "Create Pull Request"

The PR modal shows:
- Source branch (your worktree branch)
- Target branch (configurable)
- Auto-generated title and description based on your work

**Requirements:** GitHub CLI (`gh`) must be installed and authenticated. Maestro will detect if it's missing and show installation instructions.

## Use Cases

| Scenario | How Worktrees Help |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Background Auto Run** | Run Auto Run in a worktree while working interactively in the main repo |
| **Feature Branches** | Spin up a sub-agent for each feature branch |
| **Code Review** | Create a worktree to review and iterate on a PR without switching branches |
| **Parallel Experiments** | Try different approaches simultaneously without git stash/pop |

## Tips

- **Name branches descriptively** — The branch name becomes the worktree directory name
- **Use a dedicated worktree folder** — Keep all worktrees in one place (e.g., `~/worktrees/`)
- **Clean up when done** — Delete worktree sessions after merging PRs to avoid clutter
