This guide gets you from install to a first productive session with Maestro.

## 1. Install and launch

Follow the [Installation](./installation) instructions for your platform, then launch Maestro.

## 2. Create an agent

Maestro supports **Claude Code**, **OpenAI Codex**, and **OpenCode** as providers. Make sure at least one is installed and authenticated, then create your first agent in the sidebar.

## 3. Open a project

Point your new agent at a project directory. Maestro will detect git repos automatically and enable git-aware features like diffs, logs, and worktrees.

## 4. Start a conversation

Use the **AI Terminal** to talk with your AI provider, and the **Command Terminal** for shell commands. Toggle between them with `Cmd+J` / `Ctrl+J`. Each tab in the AI Terminal is a separate session.

## 5. Try Auto Run

Create a markdown checklist, then run it through Auto Run to see the spec-driven workflow in action. See [Auto Run + Playbooks](./autorun-playbooks) for a full walkthrough.
